# HazTek
"Old website I found. Probably has a bunch of good info on HazTek, but I can't crack these stupid passwords. If anyone finds anything, tell me."
"It's surprising how long it took me to find literally any info on the world's _biggest company_. I think it's because they're trying to hide what happened back in 2011. But we can't let them. Too many people died that day for the world to just forget."
