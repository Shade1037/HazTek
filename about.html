    <p class="desc">
        You may know HazTek as the company that powers the United States—but there's much more to us. HazTek is a research facility specializing in energy production, biotech innovation, and advanced weaponry. We're recognized for our cutting-edge military tech, groundbreaking genetic engineering, and the Core Stabilizer—a feat of engineering never seen before.

    <p class="desc">
        HazTek currently supplies over 95% of America's power grid, resulting in energy costs that are 2.5x lower than the national average. We also founded and maintain Dirt County and its neighboring Maple County—two of the most technologically advanced regions in the country.

    <p class="desc">
        Our partnership with the U.S. military provides over 75% of their operational tech and weaponry. The HazTek Military Operations Force ensures security across major U.S. cities—and even extends protection to allied nations abroad.
