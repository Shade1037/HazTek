    <h4 class="subtitle"><i>Well, what is HazTek?</i></h4>
    <p class="desc">
        You may know HazTek as the company that powers the United States—but there's much more to us. HazTek is a research facility specializing in energy production, biotech innovation, and advanced weaponry. We're recognized for our cutting-edge military tech, groundbreaking genetic engineering, and the Core Stabilizer—a feat of engineering never seen before.
    </p>
    <p class="desc">
        HazTek currently supplies over 95% of America's power grid, resulting in energy costs that are 2.5x lower than the national average. We also founded and maintain Dirt County and its neighboring Maple County—two of the most technologically advanced regions in the country.
    </p>
    <p class="desc">
        Our partnership with the U.S. military provides over 75% of their operational tech and weaponry. The HazTek Military Operations Force ensures security across major U.S. cities—and even extends protection to allied nations abroad.

    <h2 class="title">History</h2>
    <p class="desc">
        HazTek was founded in 1987 by Steven Dusk as a small repair company. Customers would bring in broken equipment, and Steven would personally fix them. In 2001, he passed the company down to his 20-year-old son, Elliot Dusk, who had just graduated college with a degree in biotechnology.
    </p>
    <p class="desc">Elliot, ambitious and forward-thinking, declared he had "big plans" for HazTek. Those plans materialized into a colossal underground facility spanning 27,878,400 square feet per floor, descending five levels below ground—and still expanding. Construction began in September 2021, and the first floor was completed by December 2022. The cost of building that single floor exceeded six billion dollars, funded through partnerships with multiple international companies.</p>
    <p class="desc">Once the third floor was completed, HazTek installed massive assembly machines, cutting-edge laboratories, and expansive office spaces. The company quickly transitioned into inventing and mass-producing advanced equipment—most notably weapons—which they now supply to governments and corporations around the globe.</p>
    <p class="desc">In 2006, HazTek unveiled a groundbreaking invention they described as a machine "never before seen on Earth." Dubbed the Core Stabilizer, this colossal underground geothermal engine was designed to extract energy from deep within the Earth's core—far beyond conventional geothermal systems. Once operational, HazTek began distributing this energy across the United States, generating enough revenue to fully fund the facility's ongoing operations without external support.</p>
    <p class="desc">Since the launch of the Core Stabilizer, HazTek has continued to release cutting-edge technology to the public, solidifying its reputation as a global innovator. The company now oversees an entire city built around its sprawling facility—Dirt County—which has grown into a thriving metropolis with a population exceeding 750,000 residents.</p>
    <h2 class="title">Incidents</h2>
    <p style="font-size: xx-small; text-align: center; color: aliceblue"><i>We're not trying to hide anything, so stop looking.</i></p>
    <p class="desc">As a genetics research facility, HazTek has been linked to a number of public “incidents” over the years. These events typically involve unidentified entities breaching containment and entering civilian areas. In each case, HazTek has responded with remarkable speed and precision, either neutralizing or recapturing the escaped subjects before details could fully emerge.</p>
    <p class="desc">Following the Public Anomaly Crisis of 2009, HazTek constructed a secondary site—referred to only as “Site B”—to house residual anomalies. The creatures involved, commonly known as “Anomalies” by the public, have sparked ongoing speculation about the nature of HazTek’s internal operations. Despite the facility’s growing footprint and technological advancements, little is known about what truly occurs beneath its surface.</p>
    <p class="desc">To date, over 200 civilian deaths have been attributed to these anomalies. Elliot Dusk has declined to comment on any related matters, and government agencies have consistently opted not to pursue formal investigations.</p>
